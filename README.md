Hi there, thanks for stopping by, this is the VAILO'V project team from Le Wagon in Lyon, France.

Vélo'v are the city bikes of Lyon. We often experience either empty of full stations and have no tool to anticipate.
We build a Proff of Concept for that using open data and Deep Learning.

Will you have a bike if you’re leaving in 20’ or a spot if you’re arriving in 40’ ? Let's find out together.
